# H264 Encoder

## Summary

The driver initializes and configures these hardware components, loads microcode, sets up memory buffers, and handles the encoding process by programming registers and processing interrupts. It provides an interface for userspace applications to submit encoding jobs and retrieve results.

1. Hardware Blocks:
- HCODEC: The main hardware encoder block
- VLC: Variable Length Coding block
- QDCT: Quantization and DCT block
- ME: Motion Estimation block
- IE: Intra Estimation block

2. Clocks:
- HCODEC clock (controlled via HHI_VDEC_CLK_CNTL register)

3. Resets:
- Software reset via DOS_SW_RESET1 register

4. Interrupts:
- IRQ from HCODEC block

5. Key Registers:
- HCODEC_ASSIST_MMC_CTRL1
- ENCODER_STATUS  
- HCODEC_MPSR
- HCODEC_CPSR
- Various ME/IE/QDCT configuration registers

6. Memory:
- Input buffer (DCT buffer)
- Reference buffers  
- Output bitstream buffer
- Microcode buffer
- Various internal buffers (e.g. for ME/IE)

7. DMA:
- Uses dma_buf framework for memory management

8. Canvas:
- Uses canvas for managing frame buffers
